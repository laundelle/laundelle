            <strong>Manufacturer Care Labels:</strong> We adhere rigorously to manufacturer care labels (BS EN ISO 3758). If a garment lacks a care label, has contradictory instructions, or is marked &quot;Do Not Wash / Do Not Dry Clean,&quot; we will contact you for consent before proceeding. Cleaning of such items is conducted entirely at the customer&apos;s own risk.

            <strong>Stain Removal:</strong> While our master dry cleaners utilize advanced eco-friendly stain removal technology, complete removal of certain stubborn compounds (including oxidized oil, dried ink, bleach marks, synthetic dye transfer, or acid stains) cannot be guaranteed without risking damage to the fabric fiber or dye integrity.
